# ðŸ”® Curriculum Extras Overview

This section contains optional lessons and mini-projects that can be implemented in the curriculum at the discretion of the teacher. Each optional lesson has a suggested placement, but can truly be inserted anywhere thereafter as a means to make projects that are more interesting, or to fill some time before an awkwardly placed break (or similar).

None of these lessons are 'required' to progress in the curriculum, and equally none are planned for within the general lesson sequence. However, they can be easily inserted as you see fit.
