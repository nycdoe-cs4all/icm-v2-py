# U4LA4.2: Rotations

### Teacher Notes and Overview

This lesson introduces linear transformations: rotation.

In this lesson, students are introduced to the idea of rotating elements on the canvas. This may be something your students have already asked about if they tried to figure out things like making rectangles or ovals ‘tilted’ at some point during the year! Rotations can be static - changing things but not moving - or can be used as a part of animation by incrementing a variable that controls the angle of rotation.

Students first see rotations as part of the 8th Grade Common Core standards, and then revisit them as an important part of Geometry. Depending on the grade level of your students and your school’s math trajectory, this may be a harder ask for students to recall. If necessary, provide manipulatives for students to act out what they think is meant by rotation.

The most mind-boggling thing for students in this lesson is that the default mode for angles is radians, which many will not have heard of by the time they take this class. This is fine - students can use the `radians()` function to convert degree measures to radians in their programs.

Much like translations, rotations are cumulative so students will need to continue utilizing `pushStyle()` and `popStyle()`.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Rotate shapes on the canvas
* Use incrementing variables to create animated rotations
* Combine translations with rotations

### Suggested Duration

1 period (\~45 minutes) _Plan for two days if you would look to dedicate time to having students make an animated screen saver!_

### NYS Standards

**9-12.CT.4** Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

**9-12.CT.8** Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

**9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

* **Rotation -** The process of changing the angle of the object. Rotation can be clockwise or anticlockwise.&#x20;
* **`rotate()`** - Rotates a shape the amount specified by the angle parameter.&#x20;
* **Angle** - The angle of rotation, specified in radians or degrees.&#x20;
* **Radians** - The standard mathematical way to measure angles.&#x20;
* **Degrees** - A measure for angles. There are 360 degrees in a full rotation.
