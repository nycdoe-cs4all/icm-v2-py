### Overview

In this unit, students learn to make their sketches respond to actions taken by the user, from moving the pointer to clicking or touching it over a certain area, to typing on the keyboard. The if statement is introduced. The map function is used to convert inputs into useful ranges.

Students are also introduced to the concept of functions that return values and are given space to practice reading and writing code for functions.
