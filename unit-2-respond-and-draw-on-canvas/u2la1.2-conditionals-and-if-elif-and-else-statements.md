# ✨ U2LA1.2: Conditionals and if, elif, and else statements

### Teacher Notes and Overview

**NB:** _This lesson technically covers NYS Standard **7-8.CT.8**_ _Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem. However, we know not all schools can guarantee a middle school sequence prior to this course. This lesson can be significantly abbreviated or skipped entirely based on the knowledge your students come in with!_

This learning activity builds on the students’ knowledge of conditional statements. They will use conditional statements to create a sketch of a traffic light in future lessons that changes colors based on the mouse position, and this prepares them for that activity

Students should have a solid understanding of conditionals and how it is satisfied through a boolean. This lesson will focus heavily on creating more complex algorithms through the use of conditionals. Therefore it is important that students add comments to keep track of the sketches control flow. Students will also benefit greatly from peer programming because they can model their thinking behind their code.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Use an if-then statement&#x20;
* Use else if and else statements&#x20;
* Create conditions statements (event handlers)&#x20;
* Elaborate on how to satisfy a condition.

### Suggested Duration

\~1-2 Periods (\~45-90 minutes)

### NYS Standards

_**7-8.CT.8** Develop or remix a program that reffectively combiens or or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem._

**9-12.CT.8** Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create ac omputer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

**9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

* Conditional statements - is a set of rules performed if a certain condition is met&#x20;
* Else - the second half of a conditional statement covers every outcome not specified in “if”&#x20;
* Boolean expressions - is a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE
* Expression - is a group of terms (the terms are separated by + or − signs)&#x20;
* Relational operators - < , > , >=, <=, && (and), || (or)

### Assessments

**Formative**:

* Do Now
* End of lesson code collection and reflectionr esponses

**Summative**:

* Traffic Light (Upcoming Mini Project)
* Drawing App (Upcoming Unit Final)

### Do Now/Warm Up (5 - 10 minutes)

Find the bug and add comments explaining the solution in the following Do Now Starter Code ([Trinket](https://trinket.io/python/1e78390475)).

Ask students to debug the sketch in order to change the color of the rectangle. There are 2 bugs 1) if statement is missing a curly bracket { 2) rect() must be written after the if statement.

Note: Bug number 2 is an error that will come up often for students who have difficulty with the control flow of a program. Control flow is an essential Computer science concept that students will need to master to create algorithms.

Ask Students to share out their solutions and explanations.

* Why does the rect() function have to come after the if statement?&#x20;
* How can we check for syntax errors**?**

### Elif Off the Canvas (15 - 25 minutes)

Ask students to open and duplicate the Elif Off the Canvas Starter Code ([Trinket](https://trinket.io/python/2eb97c3299)).&#x20;
