# U3LA2.4: Updating and Deleting from Lists

### Teacher Notes and Overview

In this lesson, students will learn to update and delete items from a list as they create a bubble pop game. Depending on future projects, they may use this skill often, or it may be somewhat dormant until Unit 4 - both are okay, as it offers great exposure and rounds out their skills with lists.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Add items to an existing list
* Delete items from an existing list

### Suggested Duration

\~1 Period (\~45 minutes)

### Do Now/Warm Up (\~5 - 10 minutes)

_Ensure students are working in a new project that has the collision functions added and imported, or be prepared to add/import later in the lesson._

Ask students to create a list that is prepopulated with at least 5 dictionaries that have information to draw an ellipse. They should at a minimum have the x, y, w, h information, and time permitting, have any colors they would like the circles to be.

Encourage students to use the for loops they have learned previously to do this, but if they are feeling stuck, they can do it manually.
