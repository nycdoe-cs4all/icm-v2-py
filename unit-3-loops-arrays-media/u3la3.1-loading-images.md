# U3LA3.1: Loading Images

### Teacher Notes and Overview

In this brief learning activity, students will learn to load images into their programs and display them on the canvas. This introduces a skill that many students will use for the rest of the year, and while the code itself is fairly low lift, the action of saving and using files can be a challenge.

Many students have limited experience with saving files locally. Anticipate needing to teach a lot of \[what you might think of as] basic skills, including naming conventions for files. Ideally, files should follow the same rules as variables - snake or camel case and no spaces.

Anticipate that students may also struggle with image file types - a common error is for students to accidentally save something that is not a compatible image (due to clicking the wrong option) and not realizing what they did. Because of this, we plan in time to discuss file types/extensions - this knowledge will be built onto in AP CSP, when students will also discuss lossy and lossless compression.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Identify image file types to use in their program
* Use the processing.py library to load images
* Add images to their canvas, position, and resize
