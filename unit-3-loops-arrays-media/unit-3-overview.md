# ðŸ”® Unit 3 Overview



### Overview

In this unit, students will learn how to use loops, including nested loops, to create and style repeating and iterative patterns on the canvas. Students will then move into working with lists, including all CRUD operations, before moving onto learning how to load images into their program. The unit ends with the creation of a random meme generator project.

The unit introduces new code concepts but relies heavily on the basics that have been set up in Units 1 and 2.
