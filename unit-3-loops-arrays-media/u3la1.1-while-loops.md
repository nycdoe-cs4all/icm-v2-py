# U3LA1.1: While Loops

### Teacher Notes and Overview

This lesson introduces repetition using while loops. Students will create a sketch with a repeated element to fill a specific space.

While loops is a great introduction to loops because of the syntax for declaring, conditional checking and incrementation are not as complicated as it is for a for loop.

Common misconceptions are forgetting to increment the variable, writing a valid condition and forgetting to use curly brackets. It is always important to have students write comments to debug their code.

This pair-programming experience is very open-ended - try to encourage students to talk together about features for their program, rather than each person deciding for the group when it is their turn to navigate.

Push students to think about the user experience in leaving their feedback: did they know while loop is working correctly? How could this be improved?

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Explain how the components of the while loops are essential to efficiency
* Create while loops
* Use while loops to generate multiple shapes

### Suggested Duration

45 Minutes (\~1 period)

### NYS Standards

**9-12.CT.4** Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

**9-12.CT.8** Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

**9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

* **loop** - a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is no longer met.
* **iteration** - the repetition of a process
* **while loop** - a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true
* **control structure -** a block of code that specifies the flow of a program according to specific conditions
