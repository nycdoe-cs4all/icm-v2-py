# ðŸ—ƒ U3LA3 Mini Project: Vision Board

### Teacher Notes and Overview

Students will apply their skills around images to create a vision of their goals, dream life, or whatever else will make them happy.

This is a fairly quick mini project that really drives home the process of finding, uploading, and manipulating images on the screen. That being said, we want to encourage the creation of pieces that are aesthetically pleasing and cohesive, rather than just a gridded page of boxy images that a student threw together.

Encourage students to mess with tint and also seek images with transparent backgrounds so that they can overlap and create interesting compositions. Use the sample output liberally!

### Suggested Duration

2-4 Periods (\~90 - 180 minutes)

### Prompt

Spend some time pondering on the following questions:

1. What are goals you have for yourself this year?&#x20;
2. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Be as specific and give as many details as possible!&#x20;
3. Imagine your dream life. Where do you live? What do you do? Tell us all about it.

In this project, you'll be making an interactive vision board. Vision boards are things people often create to keep their goals at the front of their mind and help them visualize and manifest what they want out of life. Yours will be done in Processing.py!

#### Requirements

* Gather images that represent your dream life in the coming year. (Donâ€™t care so much about the coming year? Think about your dream life after high school, or after college.)&#x20;
* Figure out a way to display these images that is fun, interesting, and reinforces your dream. (If your dream is to be more organized, maybe your board reflects that!)&#x20;
* Use tint to create a foreground, middle-ground, background, and/or to make the images go better together.&#x20;
* Make your vision board interactive! Make something change or appear when the mouse hovers over a certain area, when the mouse is clicked, or when a button is pressed.
* Do your best to keep your code organized and efficient; that may mean writing functions, using lists/dictionaries, and/or utilizing loops to avoid repeating yourself

#### Writing Prompts

1. What is your vision for your life?&#x20;
2. How does this program capture that?&#x20;
3. What are things you will need to do to make your dreams a reality?

### Culturally Responsive Best Practices

Within this design-based challenge, there are many prompts you can give students to make the project seem more relevant to them and the cultures of communities that they are a part of. (_Please recall that communities can refer to a lot of things, including just the culture of being a teen, a Minecraft player, or a KPop fan - be mindful that you are allowing students to explore choice in their creations in a way that is authentic to them!)_

### Extensions

* When an object is clicked or hovered on, display a message or reminder about how to achieve that dream.&#x20;
* Make an element of your vision board vary each time to program is run, or change based on key presses or clicks.&#x20;
* Use a for loop to draw an image repeatedly.
