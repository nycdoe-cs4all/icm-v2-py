# Curriculum Overview

### üöß üöú **CURRICULUM EXTRAS RESOURCES BEING ADDED** üöú **üöß**

**This curriculum is Version 2.0 of our** [**original ICM curriculum**](https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/introduction-to-computational-media-curriculum/) **using the Python version of Processing.** It moves a little quicker (in a different language!) and aims to hit all standards from the Computational Thinking category of the NYS Computing Standards. [_Looking for ICM Version 2.0 in p5.js?_](https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/js-intro-to-computational-media-2.0/)

This curriculum was built on the foundation of **ICM Version 1.0**. **Version 1.0** was developed by the [NYCDOE CS4All](http://cs4all.nyc/) academics team (Jos√© Olivares, EJ Park) with lead writer [Luisa Pereira](http://www.luisapereira.net/). Additional contributors to the curriculum include Courtney Morgan üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è & Jos√© Orea (teacher implementation guide and additional activities), Esther Hersh, and the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/). Curricular reorganization, rewrites, and extras were developed by Courtney Morgan.

**ICM Version 2.0 \[PY]** was planned, adapted, and developed by Courtney Morgan.

### AP CSP and ICM

While this is an introductory computer science course, it can serve as a terrific AP Computer Science Principles Prep course. The guides below were developed based on **Curriculum Version 1.0 \[JS],** but you can still use the guides below to assist if you are a teacher whose students will eventually take AP CSP, or who is just looking to broaden the content covered within this course:

* [AP CSP/ICM Companion Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci--4DONVH2xYddqeAq8F4\_RmlgBY\_Tvug56ueWhBj0/preview) (DRAFT - needs 2.0 updates!)
* [Social Implications of Computing Companion Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GVzOsjulSYxlEj51HJCFeo64VuXrf3aHdA2zH4X8cv8/preview) (DRAFT - needs 2.0 updates)

### Class Resource Examples
