# ðŸ”® Unit 5 Overview

This unit is \*entirely optional\* and will mostly consist of a prompt and suggestions for running a multi-week, open-ended final project. It will also have several optional lesson modules that will allow students to extend their learning - these lessons are not required to complete the project, but rather serve as extensions and filler for classrooms that are moving at a quicker rate.
