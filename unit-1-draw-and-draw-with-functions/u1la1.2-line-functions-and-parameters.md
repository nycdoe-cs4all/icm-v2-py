# U1LA1.2 Line Functions and Parameters

### Teacher Notes and Overview

In this learning activity, students will create a visual composition using the Processing.py shape-drawing functions point() and line(). They will be introduced to functions, parameters, and then how to call them in Processing.py.

Students should have already created an account and know how to log in. If not it would be good to model it before reviewing the editor.

This lesson will be the first time that many students will be coding along with the teacher; give students enough time to copy as they get accustomed to code-alongs. Giving students access to the slide deck will help with questions, sharing links, and entry points for anyone who may have gotten off track or needs help.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Understand the Processing.py canvas coordinate system
* Consult the Processing.py reference for documentation
* Create a line and point
* Change the grayscale value of a canvas
* Use lines to create a rectangle or a house

### Suggested Duration

1 Period (\~45 minutes)

### NYS Standards

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

**9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

* **IDE -** Integrated development area or IDE is a software application that provides a place for computer programmers to develop code.
* **Function -** Functions are lines of code that perform specific tasks.
* **Parameters or Arguments -** are the values inside of parenthesis following the name of the function. These are used to change the outcome of a function

**Pre-Req Vocab:**

* **Width -** Horizontal distance of a 2D shape
* **Height -** Vertical distance of a 2D shape
* **Cartesian (Coordinate) Plane -** four-quadrant grid with an x && y-axis, origin, etc.
* **Vertices -** a point where two or more lines meet
