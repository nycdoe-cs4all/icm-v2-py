# ✨ U1LA3.1: Introducing Variables

### Teacher Notes and Overview

**NB:** _This lesson technically covers NYS Standard **7-8.CT.7**_ _Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information. However, we know not all schools can guarantee a middle school sequence prior to this course. This lesson can be significantly abbreviated or skipped entirely based on the knowledge your students come in with!_

In this activity, students will be introduced to the idea of variables as a word that holds data. To begin, they will focus only on system variables built into the Processing.py library. In the next lesson, they will be introduced to creating their own variables and using the random function.

The do-now introduces a headache to make students care about the built-in width and height. Expect students to struggle; very few will have completely accurate results, but some of them may \~feel\~ that they have succeeded by having something that is centered-ish. Accept that since you’re going to rain on their parade anyway.

### Objectives

**Students will be able to:**

* Use `width` and `height` variables
* Use `mouseX` and `mouseY` to move a shape
* Use system variables as arguments for functions

### Suggested Duration

\~1 period, 45 minutes

### NYS Standards

**7-8.CT.7** Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

**9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

* **Variables -** in CS, variables hold an assigned value or data of a specific type, they can also hold arrays of values which will be introduced later.
* **`width` -** system variable that holds width of canvas as declared in set up
* **`height` -** system variable that holds height of canvas as declared in setup
* **`mouseX` -** system variable that holds the current x-position of the mouse
* **`mouseY` -** system variable that holds the current y-position of the mouse
* **`console.log()` -** a function that logs a value to the console when the program is run.

**Pre-Req Vocab:**

* **Width -** Horizontal distance of a 2D shape
* **Height -** Vertical distance of a 2D shape
