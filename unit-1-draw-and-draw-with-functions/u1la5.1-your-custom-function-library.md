# U1LA5.1: Your Custom Function Library

### Teacher Notes and Overview

In this lesson, students will share what they created in the last mini-project by sharing the code itself for others to use. This is a great skill to learn that collaboration does not need to look like pair programming, and it's also a terrific time for students to get creative!

### Objectives

**Students will be able to:**

* Import libraries from other Python documents
* Store functions in a separate Python document
* Share custom functions
* Utilize the functions of their peers

### Suggested Duration

1 Period (\~45 minutes)

_This could easily become a two-period lesson if you would like students to spend more time creating with the functions they were given. Please plan accordingly!_

### NYS Standards

**9-12.CT.4** Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

**9-12.CT.5** Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

**9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.

**9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

### Vocabulary

**Library:** a document that contains a bunch of functions

| This requires students to use code from the past mini-project. You may want to create a sample, or use past code, for any students who have been absent or did not finish. | _No additional materials needed for this lesson._ |

* Custom Function Library Project

**Summative:**

* Abstract Album Art (Upcoming Unit Project)

### Do Now/Warm Up (\~2 - 3 minutes)

Ask students to open their custom emoji and also a tab with a fresh project in Trinket (or whatever editor you choose to use). Depending on the time allotted, students can make any final tweaks to their emoji functions. (Stress that this is the _function_, not the design they made with it that they will be adjusting!)

### Creating Documentation (\~5 - 10 minutes)

Since the start of the year, you've been using functions written by other people and _documentation_ that explains how they work. It is always a best practice to leave documentation in your code - and especially within your function - with the assumption that someone else might be using your code one day. (And, honestly, that someone else might just be Future You.)

An easy way to do this is to leave a special kind of comment called a docstring at the top of your function. In some code editors, this will auto-generate helper text that explains the function when you start using it! We want to describe not only what our function does, but what the inputs do, as well. And we should add our name for good measure! So if we use the very first `happyFace()` function we wrote, the documentation might look like this:

```
def happyFace(xPos, yPos):
```
